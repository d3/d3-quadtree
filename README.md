A [quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) recursively partitions two-dimensional space into squares, dividing each square into four equally-sized squares. Each distinct point exists in a unique leaf node; coincident points are represented by a linked list. Quadtrees can accelerate various spatial operations, such as the [Barnes–Hut approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes–Hut_simulation) for computing many-body forces, collision detection, and searching for nearby points.
